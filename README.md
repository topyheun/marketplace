## Introduction
The <U>**Topy's Marketplace**</U> is a trading platform where users can buy and sell goods.

I am undertaking this project to learn the following technologies:

- Clean Code
- AWS
- Mockito for unit testing
- Handling concurrency issues using Redis
- Processing large volumes of data with Spring Batch
