## Introduction
The <U>**Topy's Marketplace**</U> is a trading platform where users can buy and sell goods.

I am undertaking this project to learn the following technologies:
- DDD (Domain-Driven Design) architecture design
- Clean Code
- AWS (Amazon Web Services)
- Mockito for unit testing
- Handling concurrency issues using Redis
- Processing large volumes of data with Spring Batch
- Handling high traffic loads through caching
- Implementing CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) with Jenkins or Git Actions

The details of the project's main tasks are summarized in [[ Issues ]](https://github.com/topyheun/topy/issues).
